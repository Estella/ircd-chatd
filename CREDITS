ircd-seven has been developed to meet the policy needs of the
freenode IRC network. The ircd is based closely on Charybdis
(http://www.atheme.org/project/charybdis) which in turn is an
evolution from ircd-ratbox. Charybdis has a dedicated, large
and active development team with whom we have worked closely
throughout the development of ircd-seven.
 
ircd-seven development is currently led by Stephen Bennett
(spb, stephen -at- freenode.net)
